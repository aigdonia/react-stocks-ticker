# React Stocks Ticker application

This is a simple react app that fetches data from polygon.io and displays the list of tickers for stocks.
with a light splash screen that displays until initial required application data is fetched from

## Used Libraries
- *Axios*: It gives me a hand with controlling HTTP requests.
- *Tanstack - React Query*: I use react query to fetch data from polygon.io, control cached requests results to avoid duplicate requests, and reduce load on API
- *RadixUI*: basically I inspired from ShadCN, but I only grabbed what I needed for the scope of this task/project.
- *Sonner*: sonner to display toast notifications

## Implementation
- [] A Splash Screen that displays until initial required application data is fetched from polygon.io
- [x] Explore page with search input, and tickers list, infinite scrolling.
- [] Tickers backend search.
- [] Toaster for notifing user with request errors, progressing requests and any other notifications may be needed.
- [] Unit tests.
